# FaceVerification_EE4708
This project was part of the course EE4708-Data Analytics Laboratory, offered by Indian Institute of Technology-Madras.

Sorry if the files aren't self explanatory. Lost most of the files and this was all I could get.

The task was to compare two given pictures and predict if they match are not. The file **yale_faces_problem_statement.ipynb** contains the detailed explanation.

We used Histogram Oriented Gradients(HOG) to extract relevant features. Random Forest Regressor was deployed to predict if the faces matched.
